	<h1 > Assembly language: </h1> 
	
	<p class=" text2" >is a low-level programming language for a computer or other programmable device specific to a particular computer architecture in contrast to most high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple systems. Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler like NASM, MASM, etc</p>
	
	<p>
Each personal computer has a microprocessor that manages the computer's arithmetical, logical, and control activities
</p>
	<p>Each family of processors has its own set of instructions for handling various operations such as getting input from keyboard, displaying information on screen and performing various other jobs. These set of instructions are called 'machine language instructions'</p>
	<p>A processor understands only machine language instructions, which are strings of 1's and 0's. However, machine language is too obscure and complex for using in software development. So, the low-level assembly language is designed for a specific family of processors that represents various instructions in symbolic code and a more understandable form.</p>

	<legend  > <b>	Advantages of Assembly Language </b> </legend> 
	
	<ol>
		<li > 	It requires less memory and execution time</li>
	<li >	It allows hardware-specific complex jobs in an easier way
	</li>
	<li > 	It is suitable for time-critical jobs
	</li>
	<li >	It is most suitable for writing interrupt service routines and other memory resident programs.

	<h1>Basic Features of PC Hardware</h1>
	<P style="font-size:20px">The main internal hardware of a PC consists of processor, memory, and registers. Registers are processor components that hold data and address. To execute a program, the system copies it from the external device into the internal memory. The processor executes the program instructions
</P>
	<p style="font-size:20px">The fundamental unit of computer storage is a bit; it could be ON (1) or OFF (0) and a group of 8 related bits makes a byte on most of the modern computers.</p>
	<p style="font-size:20px" >So, the parity bit is used to make the number of bits in a byte odd. If the parity is even, the system assumes that there had been a parity error (though rare), which might have been caused due to hardware fault or electrical disturbance.</p>
	<ol>
		<h1>The processor supports the following data sizes </h1>
		<li>		Word: a 2-byte data item</li>
		<li>		Doubleword: a 4-byte (32 bit) data item</li>
		<li>	Quadword: an 8-byte (64 bit) data item</li>
		<li>		Paragraph: a 16-byte (128 bit) area </li>
		<li>		Kilobyte: 1024 bytes</li>
		<li>		Megabyte: 1,048,576 bytes</li>
	
	</ol>
	<h1>Binary Number System</h1>
	<p>Every number system uses positional notation, i.e., each position in which a digit is written has a different positional value. Each position is power of the base, which is 2 for binary number system, and these powers begin at 0 and increase by 1.</p>
	<table border="3" width="200"> 
	<caption > The following table shows the positional values for an 8-bit binary number, where all bits are set ON </caption> 
	<tr>
	<td>Bit Value</td> 
	<td>1</td>
	<td>1</td> 
	<td>1</td>
	<td>1</td> 
	<td>1</td>
	<td>1</td> 
	<td>1</td>
	<td>1</td> 
	
	</tr> 
	
	<tr> 
	<td>position Value as power of base 2</td> 
	<td>128</td>
	<td>64</td> 
	<td>32</td>
	<td>16</td> 
	<td>8</td>
	<td>4</td> 
	<td>2</td>
	<td>1</td>
	
	</tr> 
	<tr> 
	<td>Bit Number</td> 
	<td>7</td>
	<td>6</td> 
	<td>5</td>
	<td>4</td> 
	<td>3</td>
	<td>2</td> 
	<td>1</td>
	<td>0</td>
	
	</tr> 
	
	</table>
	<br>
	<h3>The value of a binary number is based on the presence of 1 bits and their positional value. So, the value of a given binary number is </h3>
	
	<p>1 + 2 + 4 + 8 +16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255
which is same as 28 - 1.
